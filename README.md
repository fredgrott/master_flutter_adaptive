# Master Flutter Adaptive

For almost 3 years the Flutter team has been stumbling around in the adaptive scaffold area. And we still do not have a production quality solution.

Time for engineering to solve it instead of bureaucracy!

I am breaking this up into parts and making it small enough in units so you get an education on the GoRouter API and some other APIs.
