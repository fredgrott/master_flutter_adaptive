# Master Flutter Adaptive

Eff it, 3 years of promosing an adaptie scaffold that handles foldable layouts and still nothing! So I am building up projects 
towards the full working adaptive scaffold and canonical layout example.

Credits go to GSKinner, Google Flutter Team, and Microsoft for discovering pieces of the full adaptive approach. I just modify those gems to fit it together in a full adaptive scaffold and canonical layout example.
